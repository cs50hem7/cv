  I am learning Computer Science at the
  <a href = "http: // www.salford.ac.uk">University of Salford</a>.
  I decided to study my course at Salford because:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The staff are <em> so </em> friendly,</li>
  <li>it is <strong> easy </strong> to get to by the train , and </li>
  <li>they use <strong>GNU/Linux (some of the time) </strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>
  My course is provided by the School of Computing, Science & Enginneering ,which is based in the Newton
  Building. The Newton Building was not built recently, and would benefit from some improvements. If it were my decision I would:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve the lighting in the second floor computer labs</li>
  <li>Fix the heating !</li>
  <li>Decorate the staff offices </li>
  <li>Improve the building entrance</li>
</ul>

  <dd> This module covers Personal Development Planning.</dd>
  <dt> Web Page Design </dt>
